                    The average cost of living in the USA is estimated to be between $2,500 and $3,500 per month,
                    depending on location and lifestyle. The two major components that make up the overall cost of
                    living in USA are accommodation and meal expenses. If your budget is limited, it is better to choose
                    student accommodation. The cost of living is comparatively higher for students living in cities than
                    those living in suburban parts of the US. Besides, some expenses are unavoidable. Here is a
                    breakdown of general living expenses in the US for international students to know before creating a
                    budget plan.
