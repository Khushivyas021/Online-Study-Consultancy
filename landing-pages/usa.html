                    International students who want to study in Canada need a study permit. It is a necessary

                    Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA). Alongside the study permit, you need a visitor visa or eTA to
                    enter legally. This permit is essential for Indian students which grants permission to study at
                    Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs) in Canada.

                    Please note that a study permit is not a visa. A student visa will authorize your entry to Canada.
                    To apply for a Canadian Student Visa, it's best to start the process 4 to 6 months before your
                    classes begin and after you've received an Admission Offer from a Canadian Designated Learning
                    Institute. You can apply online using the Government of Canada Key (GCKey) portal or at a Visa
                    Application Centre (VAC) or directly at the entry port if you prefer. The fee for applying for a
                    Canadian Student Visa is $150 CAD, and it also covers a $85 CAD biometrics fee and a $45 CAD service
                    fee.
