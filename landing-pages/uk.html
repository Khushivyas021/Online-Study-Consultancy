                    International students who want to study in Canada need a study permit. It is a necessary
                    immigration document that validates their stay in Canada and accompanies a visitor visa or
                    Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA). Alongside the study permit, you need a visitor visa or eTA to
                    enter legally. This permit is essential for Indian students which grants permission to study at
                    Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs) in Canada.

                <p class="study-in-canada__heading_para">
                    Please note that a study permit is not a visa. A student visa will authorize your entry to Canada.
                    To apply for a Canadian Student Visa, it's best to start the process 4 to 6 months before your
                    classes begin and after you've received an Admission Offer from a Canadian Designated Learning
                    Institute. You can apply online using the Government of Canada Key (GCKey) portal or at a Visa
                    Application Centre (VAC) or directly at the entry port if you prefer. The fee for applying for a
                    Canadian Student Visa is $150 CAD, and it also covers a $85 CAD biometrics fee and a $45 CAD service
                    fee.

                    The study visa processing time will be around 4 to 8 weeks. If you're in a hurry, the Student Direct
                    Stream (SDS) option processes it in just 20 days. Indian students are eligible for the SDS category
                    and can apply by submitting the necessary documents for their student visa.
